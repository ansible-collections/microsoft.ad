LDAP Inventory guide
********************

This guide covers information about the LDAP inventory plugin included in this collection. This inventory plugin can be used to build an inventory from an LDAP server source, like Microsoft Active Directory.

.. _ansible_collections.microsoft.ad.docsite.guide_ldap_inventory.connection_info:

Connection info
===============

Details on how to configure an LDAP connection can be found under :ref:`the LDAP connection guide <ansible_collections.microsoft.ad.docsite.guide_ldap_connection>`. Each of the connection options described by the plugin documentation are specified in the inventory yml configuration file like the below.

.. code-block:: yaml

    plugin: microsoft.ad.ldap

    # LDAP connection options can be defined in the yaml config.
    auth_protocol: simple
    username: UserName
    password: MyPassword123
    tls_mode: ldaps


.. _ansible_collections.microsoft.ad.docsite.guide_ldap_inventory.attributes:

Attributes
==========

The LDAP inventory plugin can be used to set custom facts for each host it retrieves based on the computer object's LDAP attributes. Retrieving custom attributes is done through the ``attributes`` option in the inventory plugin definition. The value is set to one of the three following types:

* Empty string or null
* A template string
* A dictionary

.. note::
    While an individual attribute can only be set to one of these types, it is possible to use the different value types for different attributes.

It is also possible to use the ``compose`` inventory option to use the builtin compose templating provided by inventory plugins but the LDAP attributes must first be requested through the ``attributes`` option and referenced in the ``compose`` template through the host fact the ``attributes`` set it on.

Empty string or null
--------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

    attributes:
      comment:
      objectSid: ''
      ms-Mcs-AdmPwd:

In this case each of the attribute values will be set as a host fact as they are coerced by the LDAP schema, see :ref:`value types and templating <ansible_collections.microsoft.ad.docsite.guide_ldap_inventory.value_types>`. The name of each fact will be based on the attribute name with ``-`` being replaced by ``_``. In the above example the host facts ``comment``, ``objectSid``, and ``ms_Mcs_AdmPwd`` will be set to the coerced values.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # ansible-inventory -i microsoft.ad.ldap.yml --host MYHOST --vars --yaml

    ansible_host: MYHOST.domain.com
    comment: test comment
    ms_Mcs_AdmPwd: Password123!
    objectSid: S-1-5-21-1234-1108
    microsoft_ad_distinguished_name: CN=MYHOST,CN=Computers,DC=domain,DC=com


Template string
---------------

.. code-block:: yaml

    attributes:
      comment: this
      objectSid: raw | microsoft.ad.as_sid
      ms-Mcs-AdmPwd: raw | first

This format will set the host fact based on the template value specified. Each template is implicitly wrapped with ``{{ ... }}`` and processed through Jinja2 to produce a result. This means the template string can contain filters provided by Ansible and other collections to convert the raw LDAP value into something more useful. The ``this`` variable refers to the coerced LDAP attribute value and ``raw`` refers to a list of base64 encoded byte strings of the raw LDAP attribute value. See :ref:`value types and templating <ansible_collections.microsoft.ad.docsite.guide_ldap_inventory.value_types>` for more information around what can be done inside the templates. Each host fact will be named after the attribute name with ``-`` being replaced by ``_``. In the above example the host facts ``command``, ``objectSid``, and ``ms_Mcs_AdmPwd`` will be set to the template results.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # ansible-inventory -i microsoft.ad.ldap.yml --host MYHOST --vars --yaml

    ansible_host: MYHOST.domain.com
    comment: test comment
    ms_Mcs_AdmPwd: UGFzc3dvcmQxMjMh
    objectSid:
    - S-1-5-21-1234-1108
    microsoft_ad_distinguished_name: CN=MYHOST,CN=Computers,DC=domain,DC=com


Dictionary
----------

.. code-block:: yaml

    attributes:
      comment:
        # Jinja2 native types will automatically convert this to a dict as
        # the value is a json string.
        my_comment:
        other_var: this | from_json
      objectSid:
        sid: raw | microsoft.ad.as_sid | first
      ms-Mcs-AdmPwd:
        ansible_password: this

The final value that can be set on each attribute values is a dictionary where the keys are the host facts to set and the value is the template used to dervice the final value. It can be null or an empty string to refer to the LDAP coerced value of that attribute (``this``) or a template string to template a new value based on the requirements at hand. See the above two formats for more info on null/empty string vs a string template value. In the above example there are 4 host facts set:

* ``my_command`` - the coerced value for the ``comment`` attribute
* ``other_var`` - a dictionary created from the coerced value of ``comment`` if it was a json string
* ``sid`` - the computer SID value as a string derived from ``objectSid``
* ``ansible_password`` - the LAPS password coerced value derived from ``ms-Mcs-AdmPwd``

.. code-block:: yaml

    # ansible-inventory -i microsoft.ad.ldap.yml --host MYHOST --vars --yaml

    ansible_host: MYHOST.domain.com
    ansible_password: Password123!
    my_comment:
      foo: bar
    other_var:
      foo: bar
    sid: S-1-5-21-1234-1108
    microsoft_ad_distinguished_name: CN=MYHOST,CN=Computers,DC=domain,DC=com

.. note::
    The host fact names are used literally, there are no conversions from ``-`` to ``_`` when using this format.


.. _ansible_collections.microsoft.ad.docsite.guide_ldap_inventory.inventory_hostname:

Inventory hostname
==================

By default the ``inventory_hostname`` for a found host will be based on the ``name`` LDAP attribute value. If the ``dNSHostName`` attribute is set for the computer account found, it will be set as the ``ansible_host`` fact. To define a custom ``inventory_hostname`` or ``ansible_host`` either set it in the ``attributes`` or ``compose`` plugin option under that key. For example this will set the ``inventory_hostname`` to the value of ``sAMAccountName`` without the ending ``$`` rather than the computer account LDAP ``name`` attribute.

.. code-block:: yaml

    attributes:
      sAMAccountName:
      inventory_hostname: sAMAccountName[:-1]

.. code-block:: yaml

    # ansible-inventory -i microsoft.ad.ldap.yml --host MYHOST --vars --yaml

    ansible_host: MYHOST.domain.com
    microsoft_ad_distinguished_name: CN=OtherName,CN=Computers,DC=domain,DC=com
    sAMAccountName: MYHOST$


It is also possible to set ``inventory_hostname`` under the ``compose`` key. The following will produce the same output as the above.

.. code-block:: yaml

    attributes:
      sAMAccountName:

    compose:
      inventory_hostname: sAMAccountName[:-1]


An example of setting a custom ``ansible_host`` fact that is used as the connection host but leaving the default ``inventory_hostname`` of the computer account name is:

.. code-block:: yaml

    attributes:
      sAMAccountName:
      ansible_host: sAMAccountName[:-1]


.. _ansible_collections.microsoft.ad.docsite.guide_ldap_inventory.value_types:

Value types and templating
==========================

Each LDAP attribute value is stored as a list of bytes but the schema supplied in the LDAP database can describe how those raw list of bytes are represented as a proper type, like a string, integer, boolean, etc. Currently only these four types are used when coercing LDAP attribute values

* Booleans
* Integers
* Bytes
* Strings

Booleans, integers, and strings are coerced into those specific Python types but bytes are coerced into a base64 string encoding of those bytes.

.. note::
    The ``objectGuid`` and ``objectSid`` attributes are always coerced into strings representing the security identifier and guid respectively. These are the only attributes that have special coercion rules outside of the LDAP schema syntax.

LDAP attribute values may also be marked as a a single or multi valued attribute. A single value contains just the coerced value, or ``None/null`` if it has not been set while a multi valued attribute will be set as a list of coerced values. For example the ``comment`` is a single valued string while ``servicePrincipalName`` is a multi valued string. Using this inventory configuration that requests ``comment``, and ``servicePrincipalName`` we get the following inventory host definition:

.. code-block:: yaml

    plugin: microsoft.ad.ldap

    attributes:
      comment:
      servicePrincipalName:


.. code-block:: yaml

    # ansible-inventory -i microsoft.ad.ldap.yml --host MYHOST --vars --yaml

    ansible_host: MYHOST.domain.com
    comment: test comment
    servicePrincipalName:
    - WSMAN/MYHOST
    - WSMAN/MYHOST.domain.com
    - TERMSRV/MYHOST
    - TERMSRV/MYHOST.domain.com
    - RestrictedKrbHost/MYHOST
    - HOST/MYHOST
    - RestrictedKrbHost/MYHOST.domain.com
    - HOST/MYHOST.domain.com
    microsoft_ad_distinguished_name: CN=MYHOST,CN=Computers,DC=domain,DC=com

Some attributes like ``pwdLastSet`` are typically represented as a datetime value but internally are stored as integers. As there is no metadata in the LDAP schema to denote these integer values as datetime objects they will only be coerced into integer values by default.

The following filters can be used as an easy way to further convert the coerced values into something more readable:

* :ref:`microsoft.ad.as_datetime <ansible_collections.microsoft.ad.as_datetime_filter>`
* :ref:`microsoft.ad.as_guid <ansible_collections.microsoft.ad.as_guid_filter>`
* :ref:`microsoft.ad.as_sid <ansible_collections.microsoft.ad.as_sid_filter>`

An example of these filters being used in the ``attributes`` option can be seen below:

.. code-block:: yaml

    plugin: microsoft.ad.ldap

    attributes:
      pwdLastSet:
        password_last_set_int: this
        password_last_set_datetime: this | microsoft.ad.as_datetime

.. code-block:: yaml

    # ansible-inventory -i microsoft.ad.ldap.yml --host MYHOST --vars --yaml

    ansible_host: MYHOST.domain.com
    password_last_set_datetime: 2023-02-06T07:39:09.195321+0000
    password_last_set_int: 133201427491953218
    microsoft_ad_distinguished_name: CN=MYHOST,CN=Computers,DC=domain,DC=com

The templates can also reference other filters that exist outside the collection, like the Ansible builtin ``from_json`` and more. The value is simply what would be placed inside ``{{ ... }}`` during a normal template operation.

.. note::
    Lookups cannot be used in the attribute value templates, only filters.

Each template used in the ``attributes`` inventory option can reference the following variables:

* ``this``
* ``raw``
* Any previously defined attributes

The ``this`` variable refers to the coerced LDAP attribute value while ``raw`` refers to the list of base64 encoded strings representing the raw LDAP value that hasn't been coerced. As each attribute host fact is processed, it is also available in the subsequent templates under that host fact name. Here is an example of a more complex set of attributes:

.. code-block:: yaml

    plugin: microsoft.ad.ldap

    attributes:
      objectSid:
        sid: this
        sid_raw: raw
        sid_raw_filtered: raw | microsoft.ad.as_sid | first
      objectGuid:
      sAMAccountName:
        computer_name:
      comment:
        comment: this
        # Can refer to previously set attributes above
        description: computer_name ~ " - " ~ sid ~ " - " ~ objectGuid ~ " - " ~ this

    # Can also be used as a template and refer to the vars retrieved above
    compose:
      comment2: comment

.. code-block:: yaml

    # ansible-inventory -i microsoft.ad.ldap.yml --host MYHOST --vars --yaml

    ansible_host: MYHOST.domain.com
    comment: test comment
    comment2: test comment
    computer_name: MYHOST$
    description: MYHOST$ - S-1-5-21-1234-1108 - 51cc490f-1de0-41ae-98ad-dc065d5b33e2 - test comment
    objectGuid: 51cc490f-1de0-41ae-98ad-dc065d5b33e2
    sid: S-1-5-21-1234-1108
    sid_raw:
    - AQMAAAAAAAUVAAAA0gQAAFQEAAA=
    sid_raw_filtered: S-1-5-21-1234-1108
    microsoft_ad_distinguished_name: CN=MYHOST,CN=Computers,DC=domain,DC=com


.. _ansible_collections.microsoft.ad.docsite.guide_ldap_inventory.laps:

LAPS
====

Local Administrator Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) can be used to automatically change the password of the local administrator account on domain joined hosts. The LDAP connection plugin can retrieve the LAPS-managed value and assign it as the connection password for the target host.

There are three different attributes that can be used by LAPS to store the password information:

* ``ms-Mcs-AdmPwd`` - The legacy LAPS attribute containing the password
* ``msLAPS-Password`` - The Windows LAPS attribute containing the username and password
* ``msLAPS-EncryptedPassword`` - The Windows LAPS attribute containing the encrypted username and password

If using the legacy LAPS setup, the following will retrieve and assign the connection username and password to the LAPS-managed value:

.. code-block:: yaml

    plugin: microsoft.ad.ldap

    attributes:
      ms-Mcs-AdmPwd:
        ansible_user: '"Administrator"'
        ansible_password: this

.. code-block:: yaml

    # ansible-inventory -i microsoft.ad.ldap.yml --host MYHOST --vars --yaml

    ansible_host: MYHOST.domain.com
    ansible_password: aR$lmrqK1l622H
    ansible_user: Administrator
    microsoft_ad_distinguished_name: CN=MYHOST,CN=Computers,DC=domain,DC=com

.. note::
    Legacy LAPS does not store the username, the above example hardcodes the user name ``Administrator``.

If using Windows LAPS without encryption, the following will assign the connection username and password to the LAPS-managed values:

.. code-block:: yaml

    plugin: microsoft.ad.ldap

    attributes:
      msLAPS-Password:
        ansible_user: (this | from_json).n
        ansible_password: (this | from_json).p
        raw_example: raw
        this_example: this

.. code-block:: yaml

    # ansible-inventory -i microsoft.ad.ldap.yml --host MYHOST --vars --yaml

    ansible_host: MYHOST.domain.com
    ansible_password: AWznso@ZJ+J6p9
    ansible_user: Administrator
    microsoft_ad_distinguished_name: CN=MYHOST,CN=Computers,DC=domain,DC=com
    raw_example:
    - eyJuIjoiQWRtaW5pc3RyYXRvciIsInQiOiIxZDk4MmI0MzdiN2E1YzYiLCJwIjoiQVd6bnNvQFpKK0o2cDkifQ==
    this_example:
      n: Administrator
      p: AWznso@ZJ+J6p9
      t: 1d982b437b7a5c6

Unlike Legacy LAPS, the attribute value is a json string that contains the keys:

* ``n`` - The account name the password was encrypted for
* ``p`` - The password for the account
* ``t`` - The time the password was set encoded as a FILETIME in base16

.. note::
    It is recommended to use the ``from_json`` filter (as shown in the example above) on the ``this`` value to ensure consistent behavior in the presence or absence of Jinja2 native type support.

Getting an encrypted Windows LAPS value requires the ``dpapi-ng`` Python library to be installed. See :ref:`the LDAP connection requirements <ansible_collections.microsoft.ad.docsite.guide_ldap_connection.requirements>` for more information on this optional package and how to debug whether it's installed or not.

.. note::
    Using Windows LAPS encrypted password is currently an experimental feature.

With the ``dpapi-ng`` package installed, an authorized LDAP user can decrypt and assign the LAPS-managed username and password to the target host connection as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    plugin: microsoft.ad.ldap

    attributes:
      msLAPS-EncryptedPassword:
        ansible_user: (this.value | from_json).n
        ansible_password: (this.value | from_json).p
        raw_example: raw
        this_example: this

.. code-block:: yaml

    # ansible-inventory -i microsoft.ad.ldap.yml --host MYHOST --vars --yaml

    ansible_host: MYHOST.domain.com
    ansible_password: 6jr&}yK++{0Q}&
    ansible_user: Administrator
    microsoft_ad_distinguished_name: CN=MYHOST,CN=Computers,DC=domain,DC=com
    raw_example:
    - toLZAWR7rgfk...
    this_example:
      encrypted_value: MIIETgYJKoZI...
      flags: 0
      info: ''
      update_timestamp: 133281382308674404
      value: '{"n":"Administrator","t":"1d982b607ae7b64","p":"6jr&}yK++{0Q}&"}'

The ``raw`` value contains the raw base64 encoded value as stored in AD. The ``this`` value contains a dictionary with the following keys:

* ``encrypted_value``: The encrypted password blob as a base64 string
* ``flags``: The flags set as a bitwise int value, currently these are undocumented by Microsoft
* ``update_timestamp``: The FILETIME value of when the 
* ``value``: The decrypted value containing the username and password as a JSON string
* ``debug``: Debug information that indicates why it failed to decrypt the value

The ``value`` key will only be present if the decryption process was successful. If it failed, the ``debug`` key will be present and contain the reason why it failed to be decrypted.

If the ``dpapi-ng`` library is not installed this is what the output would look like:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # ansible-inventory -i microsoft.ad.ldap.yml --host MYHOST --vars --yaml

  ansible_host: MYHOST.domain.com
  microsoft_ad_distinguished_name: CN=MYHOST,CN=Computers,DC=domain,DC=com
  raw_example:
  - toLZAWR7rgfk...
  this_example:
    debug: Cannot decrypt value as the Python library dpapi-ng is not installed
    encrypted_value: MIIETgYJKoZI...
    flags: 0
    update_timestamp: 133281382308674404

The ``value`` key is no longer present and ``debug`` contains the message that ``dpapi-ng`` is not installed.

If ``dpapi-ng`` library was installed but the connection user is not authorized to decrypt the value this is what the output would look like:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # ansible-inventory -i microsoft.ad.ldap.yml --host MYHOST --vars --yaml

  ansible_host: MYHOST.domain.com
  microsoft_ad_distinguished_name: CN=MYHOST,CN=Computers,DC=domain,DC=com
  raw_example:
  - toLZAWR7rgfk...
  this_example:
    debug: Failed to decrypt value due to error - ValueError GetKey failed 0x80070005
    encrypted_value: MIIETgYJKoZI...
    flags: 0
    update_timestamp: 133281382308674404

A simple way to test that the connection user is able to decrypt the password is to run ``Get-LapsADPassword -Identity MYHOST`` on a Windows host as that user.
