        as case insensitive to avoid changes when not needed - https://github.com/ansible-collections/microsoft.ad/issues/31
      deprecated_features:
      - Deprecating support for Server 2012 and Server 2012 R2. These OS versions
        are reaching End of Life status from Microsoft and support for using them

  1.3.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Added the missing dependency ``dpapi-ng`` to Ansible Execution Environments
        requirements file for LAPS decryption support
      - Ensure renaming and moving an object will be done with the ``domain_server``
        and ``domain_username`` credentials specified - https://github.com/ansible-collections/microsoft.ad/issues/54
      - Fix up ``protect_from_deletion`` when creating new AD objects - https://github.com/ansible-collections/microsoft.ad/issues/47
      - Fix up date_time attribute comparisons to be idempotent - https://github.com/ansible-collections/microsoft.ad/issues/57
      - microsoft.ad.user - Ensure the ``spn`` diff after key is ``spn`` and not ``kerberos_encryption_types``
      - microsoft.ad.user - treat an expired account as a password that needs to be
        changed
      minor_changes:
      - AD objects will no longer be moved to the default AD path for their type if
        no ``path`` was specified. Use the value ``microsoft.ad.default_path`` to
        explicitly set the path to the default path if that behaviour is desired.
      - microsoft.ad.ldap - Added the option ``filter_without_computer`` to not add
        the AND clause ``objectClass=computer`` to the final filter used - https://github.com/ansible-collections/microsoft.ad/issues/55

  1.4.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - Make ``name`` an optional parameter for the AD modules. Either ``name`` or
        ``identity`` needs to be set with their respective behaviours. If creating
        a new AD user and only ``identity`` is set, that will be the value used for
        the name of the object.
      - Set minimum supported Ansible version to 2.14 to align with the versions still
        supported by Ansible.

      minor_changes:
      - Added ``group/microsoft.ad.domain`` module defaults group for the ``computer``,
        ``group``, ``object_info``, ``object``, ``ou``, and ``user`` module. Users
        can use this defaults group to set common connection options for these modules
        such as the ``domain_server``, ``domain_username``, and ``domain_password``
        options.
      - Added support for Jinja2 templating in ldap inventory.

      - microsoft.ad AD modules - Added ``domain_credentials`` as a common module
        option that can be used to specify credentials for specific AD servers.
      - microsoft.ad AD modules - Added ``lookup_failure_action`` on all modules that
        can specify a list of distinguishedName values to control what should happen
        if the lookup fails.

        a specific domain server for ``delegates`` and ``managed_by``.

      - microsoft.ad.user - Support group member lookup on alternative server using
        the DN lookup syntax. This syntax uses a dictionary where ``name`` defined
        the group to lookup and ``server`` defines the server to lookup the group
        on.
