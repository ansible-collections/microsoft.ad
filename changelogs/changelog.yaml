      - microsoft.ad.group - ensure the ``scope`` and ``category`` values are checked
        as case insensitive to avoid changes when not needed - https://github.com/ansible-collections/microsoft.ad/issues/31
      deprecated_features:
      - Deprecating support for Server 2012 and Server 2012 R2. These OS versions
        are reaching End of Life status from Microsoft and support for using them
        in Ansible are nearing its end.

  1.3.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Added the missing dependency ``dpapi-ng`` to Ansible Execution Environments
        requirements file for LAPS decryption support
      - Ensure renaming and moving an object will be done with the ``domain_server``
        and ``domain_username`` credentials specified - https://github.com/ansible-collections/microsoft.ad/issues/54
      - Fix up ``protect_from_deletion`` when creating new AD objects - https://github.com/ansible-collections/microsoft.ad/issues/47
      - Fix up date_time attribute comparisons to be idempotent - https://github.com/ansible-collections/microsoft.ad/issues/57
      - microsoft.ad.user - Ensure the ``spn`` diff after key is ``spn`` and not ``kerberos_encryption_types``
      - microsoft.ad.user - treat an expired account as a password that needs to be
        changed
      minor_changes:
      - AD objects will no longer be moved to the default AD path for their type if
        no ``path`` was specified. Use the value ``microsoft.ad.default_path`` to
        explicitly set the path to the default path if that behaviour is desired.
      - microsoft.ad.ldap - Added the option ``filter_without_computer`` to not add
        the AND clause ``objectClass=computer`` to the final filter used - https://github.com/ansible-collections/microsoft.ad/issues/55

  1.4.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - Make ``name`` an optional parameter for the AD modules. Either ``name`` or
        ``identity`` needs to be set with their respective behaviours. If creating
        a new AD user and only ``identity`` is set, that will be the value used for
        the name of the object.
      - Set minimum supported Ansible version to 2.14 to align with the versions still
        supported by Ansible.
