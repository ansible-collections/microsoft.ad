        explicitly set the path to the default path if that behaviour is desired.
      - microsoft.ad.ldap - Added the option ``filter_without_computer`` to not add
        the AND clause ``objectClass=computer`` to the final filter used - https://github.com/ansible-collections/microsoft.ad/issues/55
