minor_changes:
  - >-
    microsoft.ad.user - Support group member lookup on alternative server using the DN lookup syntax.
    This syntax uses a dictionary where ``name`` defined the group to lookup and ``server`` defines the
    server to lookup the group on.
  - >-
    microsoft.ad.user - Rename the option ``groups.missing_action`` to ``groups.lookup_failure_action``
    to make the option more consistent with other modules. The ``missing_action`` option is still
    supported as an alias.
