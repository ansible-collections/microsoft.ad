  description:
    - Splits the provided LDAP DistinguishedName (C(DN)) string value giving
      you the first/leaf RDN component or the remaining/parent RDN components.
    - The rules for parsing as defined in
      L(RFC 4514,https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4514.txt).
    - Each DN contains Relative DistinguishedNames (C(RDN)) separated by C(,).
    - The returned string for each DN will be either the first/leaf RDN
      component representing the name of the object, or the remaining/parent
      components representing the parent DN path. Use the I(section) kwarg to
      control what should be returned.
    - A DN that is invalid will raise a filter error.
    - As the values are canonicalized, the returned values may not match the
      original DN string provided but do represent the same LDAP DN value.
    - Leading and trailing whitespace from each component is removed from the
      returned value.
