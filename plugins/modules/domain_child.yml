  module: domain_child
  short_description: Manage domain children in an existing Active Directory forest.
  description:
    - Ensure that a Windows Server host is configured as a domain controller as
      a new domain in an existing forest.
    - This module may require subsequent use of the
      M(ansible.windows.win_reboot) action if changes are made.
    - This module will only check if the domain specified by I(dns_domain_name)
      exists or not. If the domain already exists under the same name, no other
      options, other than the domain name will be checked during the run.
  options:
    create_dns_delegation:
      description:
        - Whether to create a DNS delegation that references the new DNS
          server that was installed.
        - Valid for Active Directory-integrated DNS only.
        - The default is computed automatically based on the environment.

    dns_domain_name:
      description:
        - The full DNS name of the domain to create.
        - When I(domain_type=child), the parent DNS domain name is derived
          from this value.

    domain_mode:
      description:
        - Specifies the domain functional level of child/tree.
        - The domain functional level cannot be lower than the forest
          functional level, but it can be higher.
        - The default is automatically computed and set.
        - Current known modes are C(Win2003), C(Win2008), C(Win2008R2),
          C(Win2012), C(Win2012R2), or C(WinThreshold).
      type: str
    domain_type:
      description:
        - Specifies the type of domain to create.
        - Set to C(child) to create a child of an existing domain as specified
          by I(dns_domain_name).
        - Set to C(tree) to create a new domain tree in an existing forest as
          specified by I(parent_domain_name). The I(dns_domain_name) must be
          the full domain name of the new domain tree to create.
      choices:
        - child
        - tree
      default: child
      type: str
    install_dns:
      description:
        - Whether to install the DNS service when creating the domain
          controller.
        - If not specified then the C(-InstallDns) option is not supplied to
          the C(Install-ADDSDomain) command, see
          L(Install-ADDSDomain,https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/addsdeployment/install-addsdomain#-installdns)
          for more information.
      type: bool
    log_path:
      description:
        - Specified the fully qualified, non-UNC path to a directory on a fixed
          disk of the local computer that will contain the domain log files.
      type: path
    parent_domain_name:
      description:
        - The fully qualified domain name of an existing parent domain to
          create a new domain tree in.
        - This can only be set when I(domain_type=tree).
      type: str
    reboot:
      description:
        - If C(true), this will reboot the host if a reboot was create the
          domain.
        - If C(false), this will not reboot the host if a reboot was required
          and instead sets the I(reboot_required) return value to C(true).
        - Multiple reboots may occur if the host required a reboot before the
          domain promotion.
        - This cannot be used with async mode.
      type: bool
      default: false
    safe_mode_password:
      description:
        - Safe mode password for the domain controller.
      required: true
      type: str
    site_name:
      description:
        - Specifies the name of an existing site where you can place the new

    sysvol_path:
      description:
        - The path to a directory on a fixed disk of the Windows host where the
          Sysvol folder will be created.
        - If not set then the default path is C(%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSVOL).
      type: path
  notes:
    - It is highly recommended to set I(reboot=true) to have Ansible manage the
      host reboot phase as the actions done by this module puts the host in a
      state where it may not be possible for Ansible to reconnect in a
      subsequent task without a reboot.
    - This module must be run on a Windows target host.
